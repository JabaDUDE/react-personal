# PROJECT: GETTING TO KNOW ME
My first React project made with Tailwindcss that show some of my favorite things to watch and play!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** ReactJS, Tailwindcss, ESLint, Vite

This was my first project with ReactJS and Tailwindcss and I wanted to do something simple, yet fun. I decided to create a small project that worked with components and props while starting to familiarize myself with some of the tools that come along with using ReactJS. I also had my first experience with building my own json file from scratch that I would use to build the cards in this project dynamically. The biggest challenge was how to create a visually pleasing card that was also simple. Ultimately, I settled for just an image that, when hovered over, would bring up more information about the card as well as a link to a site to learn more. Getting the text to overlay the image was a challenge to do in tailwindcss but I am very happy with the end result. Essentially, I created a variable for each category (i.e. Favorite Shows or Movies) and then mapped over the json of that same category to render the cards. Then I would wrap each variable in a div so I could use flexbox to make it more responsive to screensizes.


## Lessons Learned:

I didn't realize that deploying a React project on Github would be different than deploying with just vanilla javascript and CSS. While it took some trial and error, I'm happy that I learned how to effectively deploy my React project so I could showcase it. I also learned a create deal about the basics of ReactJS and tailwindcss. One of the most challenging things about this project was working on responsiveness of the images and creating a cool feature that gives more information about the image when you hover over it.

I also learned a lot more about the power of git. At some point during working on this project, I messed up deployment by force merging index.html file between branches (oops). So I had a broken project that deployed (somehow) an earlier version of the project and my local environment displayed nothing. Ultimately, it was here that I learned that how git works in working backwards with projects where I already committed changes. I was able to go backwards to an earlier commit and correct my mistake and get it working again without having to do something as tedious as deleting and recreating the repo. This was the first time working with git outside of the usual 'git add/commit/push'.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
