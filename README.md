# PROJECT: GETTING TO KNOW ME
My first React project made with Tailwindcss that show some of my favorite things to watch and play!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** ReactJS, Tailwindcss, ESLint, Vite

This was my first project with ReactJS and Tailwindcss and I wanted to do something simple, yet fun. I decided to create a small project that worked with components and props while starting to familiarize myself with some of the tools that come along with using ReactJS. I also had my first experience with building my own json file from scratch that I would use to build the cards in this project dynamically. The biggest challenge was how to create a visually pleasing card that was also simple. Ultimately, I settled for just an image that, when hovered over, would bring up more information about the card as well as a link to a site to learn more. Getting the text to overlay the image was a challenge to do in tailwindcss but I am very happy with the end result. Essentially, I created a variable for each category (i.e. Favorite Shows or Movies) and then mapped over the json of that same category to render the cards. Then I would wrap each variable in a div so I could use flexbox to make it more responsive to screensizes.


## Lessons Learned:

I didn't realize that deploying a React project on Github would be different than deploying with just vanilla javascript and CSS. While it took some trial and error, I'm happy that I learned how to effectively deploy my React project so I could showcase it. I also learned a create deal about the basics of ReactJS and tailwindcss. One of the most challenging things about this project was working on responsiveness of the images and creating a cool feature that gives more information about the image when you hover over it.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
